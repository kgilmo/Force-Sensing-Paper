abstract = {"Quantum sensing" describes the use of a quantum system, quantum properties or quantum phenomena to perform a measurement of a physical quantity. Historical examples of quantum sensors include magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices and atomic vapors, or atomic clocks. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology, with the most common platforms being spin qubits, trapped ions and flux qubits. The field is expected to provide new opportunities - especially with regard to high sensitivity - in applied physics and other areas of science. In this review, we provide an introduction to the basic principles, methods and concepts of quantum sensing from the viewpoint of the interested experimentalist.},

abstract = {Qubits have been used as linear spectrum analyzers of their environments. Here we solve the problem of nonlinear spectral analysis, required for discrete noise induced by a strongly coupled environment. Our nonperturbative analytical model shows a nonlinear signal dependence on noise power, resulting in a spectral resolution beyond the Fourier limit as well as frequency mixing. We develop a noise characterization scheme adapted to this nonlinearity. We then apply it using a single trapped ion as a sensitive probe of strong, non-Gaussian, discrete magnetic field noise. Finally, we experimentally compared the performance of equidistant vs Uhrig modulation schemes for spectral analysis.},

abstract = {The Heisenberg uncertainty principle sets a lower bound on the noise in a force measurement based on continuously detecting a mechanical oscillator's position. This bound, the standard quantum limit, can be reached when the oscillator subjected to the force is unperturbed by its environment and when measurement imprecision from photon shot noise is balanced against disturbance from measurement back-action. We applied an external force to the center-of-mass motion of an ultracold atom cloud in a high-finesse optical cavity and measured the resulting motion optically. When the driving force is resonant with the cloud's oscillation frequency, we achieve a sensitivity that is a factor of 4 above the standard quantum limit and consistent with theoretical predictions given the atoms' residual thermal disturbance and the photodetection quantum efficiency.},

abstract = {Quantum enhanced sensing is a powerful technique in which nonclassical states are used to improve the sensitivity of a measurement. For enhanced mechanical displacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the photon counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been predicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should produce an unavoidable increase in radiation pressure noise that drives the mechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far been hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal mechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the delicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum enhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical system, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily accompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying both the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental trade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement is further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the mechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be exploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the amplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal noise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a mechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne efficiency of 94{\%}. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical motion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical light enhances the measurement of the motion.},

abstract = {We report phase-coherent Doppler detection of optical dipole forces using large ion crystals in a Penning trap. The technique is based on laser Doppler velocimetry using a cycling transition in 9Be+ near 313 nm and the center-of-mass (COM) ion motional mode. The optical dipole force is tuned to excite the COM mode, and measurements of photon arrival times synchronized with the excitation potential show oscillations with a period commensurate with the COM motional frequency. Experimental results compare well with a quantitative model for a driven harmonic oscillator. This technique permits characterization of motional modes in ion crystals; the measurement of both frequency and phase information relative to the driving force is a key enabling capability--comparable to lockin detection - providing access to a parameter that is typically not available in time-averaged measurements. This additional information facilitates discrimination of nearly degenerate motional modes.},

abstract = {Mechanical transduction of torque has been key to probing a number of physical phenomena, such as gravity, the angular momentum of light, the Casimir effect, magnetism, and quantum oscillations. Following similar trends as mass and force sensing, mechanical torque sensitivity can be dramatically improved by scaling down the physical dimensions, and therefore moment of inertia, of a torsional spring. Yet now, through precision nanofabrication and sub-wavelength cavity optomechanics, we have reached a point where geometric optimization can only provide marginal improvements to torque sensitivity. Instead, nanoscale optomechanical measurements of torque are overwhelmingly hindered by thermal noise. Here we present cryogenic measurements of a cavity-optomechanical torsional resonator cooled in a dilution refrigerator to a temperature of 25 mK, corresponding to an average phonon occupation of {\textless}n{\textgreater} = 35, that demonstrate a record-breaking torque sensitivity of 2.9 yNm/Hz{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}. This a 270-fold improvement over previous optomechanical torque sensors and just over an order of magnitude from its standard quantum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mesoscopic test samples, such as micron-scale superconducting disks, can be integrated with our cryogenic optomechanical torque sensing platform, in contrast to other cryogenic optomechanical devices, opening the door for mechanical torque spectroscopy of intrinsically quantum systems.},

abstract = {The radiation pressure of light can act to damp and cool the vibrational motion of a mechanical resonator. In understanding the quantum limits of this cooling, one must consider the effect of shot noise fluctuations on the final thermal occupation. In optomechanical sideband cooling in a cavity, the finite Stokes Raman scattering defined by the cavity linewidth combined with shot noise fluctuations dictates a quantum backaction limit, analogous to the Doppler limit of atomic laser cooling. In our work we sideband cool to the quantum backaction limit by using a micromechanical membrane precooled in a dilution refrigerator. Monitoring the optical sidebands allows us to directly observe the mechanical object come to thermal equilibrium with the optical bath.},

abstract = {We introduce quantum sensing schemes for measuring very weak forces with a single trapped ion. They use the spin-motional coupling induced by the laser-ion interaction to transfer the relevant force information to the spin-degree of freedom. Therefore, the force estimation is carried out simply by observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. Three quantum probes are considered, which are represented by systems obeying the Jaynes-Cummings, quantum Rabi (in 1D) and Jahn-Teller (in 2D) models. By using dynamical decoupling schemes in the Jaynes-Cummings and Jahn-Teller models, our force sensing protocols can be made robust to the spin dephasing caused by the thermal and magnetic field fluctuations. In the quantum-Rabi probe, the residual spin-phonon coupling vanishes, which makes this sensing protocol naturally robust to thermally-induced spin dephasing. We show that the proposed techniques can be used to sense the axial and transverse components of the force with a sensitivity beyond the yN {\$}/\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashtext{\{}Hz{\}}{\}}{\$} range, i.e. in the xN{\$} /\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashtext{\{}Hz{\}}{\}}{\$} (xennonewton, {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-27{\}}{\$}).

abstract = {The ability to detect extremely small forces and nanoscale displacements is vital for disciplines such as precision spin-resonance imaging, microscopy, and tests of fundamental physical phenomena. Current force-detection sensitivity limits have surpassed 1 aN Hz(-1/2) (refs 6,7) through coupling of nanomechanical resonators to a variety of physical readout systems. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of trapped atomic ions behave as nanoscale mechanical oscillators and may form the core of exquisitely sensitive force and displacement detectors. We report the detection of forces with a sensitivity of 390 +/- 150 yN Hz(-1/2), which is more than three orders of magnitude better than existing reports using nanofabricated devices(7), and discriminate ion displacements of approximately 18 nm. Our technique is based on the excitation of tunable normal motional modes in an ion trap and detection through phase-coherent Doppler velocimetry, and should ultimately allow force detection with a sensitivity better than 1 yN Hz(-1/2) (ref. 16). Trapped-ion-based sensors could enable scientists to explore new regimes in materials science where augmented force, field and displacement sensitivity may be traded against reduced spatial resolution.},

We show that oscillating forces that are off-resonance with the motional trap frequency can be detected very efficiently by using quantum probes represented by various spin-boson models. We demonstrate that the temporal evolution of a quantum probe described by the Dicke model can be mapped on the nonlinear Ramsey interferometry which allows to detect far-detuned forces simply by measuring the collective spin populations. Moreover, we show that the measurement uncertainty can reach the Heisenberg limit by using initial spin correlated states, instead of motional entangled states. An important advantage of the sensing technique is its natural robustness against the thermally induced dephasing, which extends the coherence time of the measurement protocol. Furthermore, we introduce sensing scheme that utilize the strong spin-phonon coupling to improve the force estimation. We show that for quantum probe represented by quantum Rabi model the force sensitivity can overcome those using simple harmonic oscillator as a force sensor.},

@article{Kampel2016,
abstract = {When one seeks knowledge of the full dynamics of the displacement of a harmonic oscillator, non-commutation of the two mechanical quadratures requires a minimum added noise equal to the mechanical resonator's zero point motion. This fundamental quantum limit (QL) is a distinct bound from the standard quantum limit (SQL) that is often considered in interferometric displacement measurement. The SQL is a consequence of the non-commutation of the probe's quadratures in a specific measurement configuration and is characterized by a tradeoff between shot noise (SN) imprecision and quantum backaction that are uncorrelated. The QL and SQL reach the same limit when probing at the peak mechanical response, but the QL can be a significantly lower bound off resonance. In studies of micro-mechanical motion, there has been great interest in observing quantum backaction and approaching the SQL on mechanical resonance. However, much of what historically motivates SQL research is displacement monitoring over a wide frequency band, such as gravitational wave searches. One long-standing concept for surpassing the SQL is to introduce correlations by changing the readout quadrature as a function of frequency in a technique known as variational readout. Here we harness quantum correlations in the measurement of a macroscopic resonator by modifying the readout quadrature of an optical interferometer. By using an optomechanical device thermalized to a dilution refrigerator, we measure quantum noise far off resonance where we improve upon the off-resonance SQL for our quantum efficiency.},
